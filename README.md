## 📌 Project Overview

Most online businesses treat all customers the same way — same emails, same discounts, same offers. This wastes money and drives customers away.

**ShopLens** solves this by automatically grouping customers based on their real shopping behavior using **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) — one of the most trusted methods used by real businesses worldwide.

The system goes one step further — it can predict which group a **brand new customer** belongs to, based on just their first 2–3 purchases. This allows businesses to act early and send the right message at the right time.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Given a dataset of real e-commerce transactions, can we:
1. Automatically group existing customers into meaningful segments?
2. Predict which segment a new customer will fall into from their early purchases?
3. Recommend a marketing action for each customer segment?

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Name:** Online Retail II
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii)
- **Size:** 1M+ transactions from a real UK-based online retailer
- **Period:** 2009 – 2011
- **Features:** InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, Price, CustomerID, Country

## 🧠 Models Used

| Model | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| K-Means | ML — Clustering | Group customers into segments |
| DBSCAN | ML — Clustering | Compare with K-Means, remove noise |
| Autoencoder | DL — Neural Network | Compress features before clustering |
| Random Forest | ML — Classifier | Predict segment for new customers |

---

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
```
Data Collection → EDA → Preprocessing → RFM Features
→ Clustering (K-Means + DBSCAN) → Autoencoder (DL)
→ Classifier Training → Streamlit App → Deployment
```
